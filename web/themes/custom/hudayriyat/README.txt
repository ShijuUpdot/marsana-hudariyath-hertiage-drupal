ABOUT Modon
-----------

Modon is a base theme that provides many classes in its markup. For cleaner
markup (fewer classes), the default Stable base theme can be used instead.

To use Modon as your base theme, set the 'base theme' in your theme's .info.yml
file to "Modon":
  base theme: Modon

See https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/theming-drupal-8/using-Modon-as-a-base-theme
for more information on using the Modon theme.
